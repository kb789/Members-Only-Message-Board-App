## Description

This Members Only Message Board App was built as a part of the Odin Project: https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/nodejs-members-only

Users can create an account and login to post messages. To gain access to the club and see who posted the messages, they have to answer a trivia question correctly in order to get the secret password. They can answer a more difficult trivia question in order to gain the admin password and the ability to delete messages.  

## Technologies Used

The technologies used are Express/Node, EJS, Passport.js for authentication, and a MongoDB database. Tailwind was used for styling.
